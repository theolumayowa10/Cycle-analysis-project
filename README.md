# Menstrual Cycle Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a menstrual cycle dataset. The project examines key reproductive health metrics such as cycle length, luteal phase duration, ovulation timing, menses characteristics, and demographic factors.

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and initial exploration  
- Missing value assessment  
- Cleaning of numeric columns  
- Feature examination  
- Custom visualization functions  
- Relationship analysis between core reproductive indicators  
- Pattern discovery and descriptive insights
